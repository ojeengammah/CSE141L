# CSE141L_Processor

The machine code for the three programs are labeled program1_machine_code.txt, program2_machine_code.txt, program3_machine_code.txt and the only change needed to load a different program is in the Instruction Rom. The testbenches, prog1_tb.sv, prog2_tb.sv, prog3_tb.sv have already been modified to use our top level which doesn't have a req signal and only has a reset signal which does the same thing. The assembly code and the assembler have been provided as well, the assembler is a python program and you just run assembler.py.
